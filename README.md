# 📚 Fokus Web Application

## Overview

Fokus is a productivity web application designed to help users optimize their focus on tasks by utilizing a timer that adjusts according to different modes: focus, short rest, and long rest. This project was developed during the "Javascript: Manipulando Elementos no DOM" course from Alura, with the guidance of the teacher Luan Alves.

## ✨ Features

- **Focus Timer** ⏰: Set a 25-minute timer to focus on tasks.
- **Short Rest Timer** 💤: Set a 5-minute timer for short breaks.
- **Long Rest Timer** 🌴: Set a 15-minute timer for longer breaks.
- **Music Toggle** 🎵: Option to play or pause background music during the timer.
- **Dynamic Interface** 🎨: The interface changes based on the selected mode (focus, short rest, long rest).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation)
- Adobe Firefly (for image generation)
- Alura (project guidance and support)

## 💡 JavaScript Functions and Concepts Used

- **Variable Declaration and Usage**: Declaring variables using `let` and `const` to manage state and references to DOM elements.
- **Template Strings**: Utilizing template strings for dynamic content updates.
- **Element Properties**: Manipulating DOM element properties to reflect changes in the UI.
- **Function Parameters**: Passing parameters to functions to handle different timer durations and actions.
- **Events**: Setting up event listeners to handle user interactions like button clicks.
- **Text Formatting**: Updating and formatting text content of elements based on timer states and modes.
